                <h2>Chinese Curry Rice (Take-out Style)</h2>
                <p>This quick Chinese takeout-style chicken curry is so easy to make, but that small investment in time yields big rewards—an incredibly flavorful curry stir-fry with lots of tasty sauce!</p>
                <p>Chicken curry was one of the dishes that I always looked forward to on any trip to Chinatown, and it’s actually incredibly easy to make. You only need a handful of ingredients, many of which you probably already have in your pantry or refrigerator, and it takes 15 minutes flat to prepare.</p>
                <p>Just make sure to wear an apron or a black t-shirt, and use metal (as opposed to wood or bamboo) utensils to stir-fry this chicken curry dish. The turmeric and curry powder can leave stains. But of course, the risk is totally worth it.</p>
                <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>12 oz. boneless skinless chicken breast (340g, thinly sliced)</li>
                    <li>Vegetable oil</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon light soy sauce</li>
                    <li>2 teaspoons cornstarch (divided)</li>
                    <li>1 medium onion (halved and sliced into small wedges)</li>
                    <li>1 ½ cups chicken stock (355 ml)</li>
                    <li>4 teaspoons curry powder</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon turmeric</li>
                    <li>1/2 teaspoon sugar</li>
                    <li>salt</li>
                    <li>Optional: Peas, carrots, potato
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Steps:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>In a medium bowl, combine the sliced chicken breast, 1 teaspoon vegetable oil, 1 teaspoon soy sauce, and 1 teaspoon cornstarch.</li>
                    <li>Heat your wok over high heat until smoking. Add a couple tablespoons of oil, and then add the chicken to the pan in one layer. Stir-fry the chicken just until it turns opaque, and remove from the wok. Set aside.</li>
                    <li>Add another tablespoon of oil to the wok, and add the onions. Stir-fry for one minute, then stir in the chicken stock, curry powder, turmeric, sugar, and salt to taste.</li>
                    <li>Combine the remaining 1 teaspoon of cornstarch with 2 teaspoons of water and mix until the cornstarch is dissolved. Stir it into the curry and stock mixture, and simmer for 1 minute, until thickened. If the sauce isn’t thick enough, add more cornstarch slurry. If it’s too thick, add more chicken stock.</li>
                    <li>Add the cooked chicken back to the wok, and stir for another 30 seconds. Serve with steamed rice.</li>
                </ol>
