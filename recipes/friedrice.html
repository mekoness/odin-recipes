                <h2>X.O. Sauce Fried Rice</h2>
                <p>One of the reasons we love this fried rice is the mix of textures. Tender, juicy seared chicken, caramelized bits of XO sauce, silky egg, and ever so slightly crunchy onion and bean sprouts. There are strong flavors all around, and yet it works beautifully!</p>

                <h4>For Fried Rice:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>5 cups cooked rice</li>
                    <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
                    <li>2 large eggs (beaten)</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon ginger (minced)</li>
                    <li>1 clove garlic (a large clove, minced)</li>
                    <li>1 small onion (diced into large pieces)</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons light soy sauce</li>
                    <li>1/4 teaspoon white pepper</li>
                    <li>1/4 teaspoon sugar</li>
                    <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
                    <li>3-4 tablespoons XO sauce (to taste; we used 4)</li>
                    <li>2 cups bean sprouts (fresh mung bean sprouts)</li>
                    <li>2 scallions (chopped)</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon Shaoxing wine</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Steps:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Combine the sliced chicken breast, water, cornstarch, oil, and oyster sauce. Mix well, until the chicken has absorbed all the liquid marinade ingredients. Set aside.</li>
                    <li>Take your cooked/leftover rice. If using leftover rice, break up clumps with a spoon or the flat side of a measuring cup. If using freshly cooked rice, fluff it with a fork to let some steam off and let it cool slightly.</li>
                    <li>Heat your wok over medium high heat, and add 1 tablespoon of oil. Add the eggs, and scramble until 70% cooked. There should still be some parts that are viscous and uncooked. Immediately transfer back to the bowl you beat them in and set aside.</li>
                    <li>Heat the wok until just smoking. Spread another tablespoon of oil around your wok. Sear the marinated chicken in one layer for 20 seconds. Cook the chicken until about 80% done (it will be cooked again). Remove from the wok, and set aside.</li>
                    <li>With the wok over medium high, add the final tablespoon of oil. Add the ginger, and cook for 30 seconds. Add the garlic, and cook for an additional 30 seconds (neither should turn dark). Add the onions. Cook for 30 seconds, and add the rice. The onions should still be crunchy and mostly raw at this point. You want them to have a fresh taste in the final fried rice.</li>
                    <li>Use your metal spatula to flatten out and break up any large clumps. If the rice is cold from the refrigerator, continue stir-frying until the rice is warmed through (steam will begin to rise from it), about 5 minutes. Fresh rice cooks faster. If it is sticking to the wok, add another tablespoon of oil.</li>
                    <li>When the rice is warmed, spread it in a single layer, and let it fry until hot. Add the light soy sauce, white pepper, sugar, and salt. Mix with a scooping motion until the rice is evenly coated with sauce, and repeat the step of spreading the rice out in a single layer to let the rice fry.</li>
                    <li>Stir in the XO sauce. Then add the cooked chicken, along with any juices from the bowl. Stir-fry for 1 minute. Add the eggs, and stir to distribute.</li>
                    <li>Add the bean sprouts and scallions, and continue stir-frying for another 30 seconds. Then gather all the rice to the middle of the wok to let the sides of the wok heat up.</li>
                    <li>After about 20 seconds, spread the Shaoxing wine around the perimeter of the wok and stir-fry the rice together for another 20 seconds. This step gives you a little of that extra "wok hei" that you taste when you get fried rice from a good Chinese restaurant. Serve!</li>
